We continuously try to upgrade our internal processes. One of the most important things is staying up-to-date with the technologies we use.

Browsing the web for tech news can be cumbersome. It is fairly easier to subscribe to various newsletters that send interesting content once in a while to our inbox.

## Ruby newsletters

We've subscribed to the following newsletters to stay up-to-date with Ruby:

[RubyDrops](https://rubydrops.ongoodbits.com/)—our very own Nenad sends out a digest of news about Ruby and Rails (and beyond that) with a few carefully chosen links to read on a weekly basis.

[Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com/)—the best Ruby world news resource. It is published every Thursday.

[This week in Rails](https://rails-weekly.ongoodbits.com/)—an excellent lightweight weekly overview of patches and new features added to Rails by various contributors. It is published every Sunday. The same content can be found at [Ruby on Rails Weblog](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/).

## Database newsletters

We use stuff that goes beyond Ruby & Rails, primarily databases:

[DB Weekly](http://dbweekly.com/)—a weekly round-up of database technology news and articles covering new developments, SQL, NoSQL, document databases, graph databases, and more.

[Postgres Weekly](http://postgresweekly.com/)—once-a-week email round-up of PostgreSQL news and articles.

## Recommended blogs

[Capsized Eight](https://infinum.co/the-capsized-eight/tags/ruby)—we run Capsized Eight, a blog about various technologies Infinum uses, where you can find a fair amount of Ruby/Rails blog posts.

[Giant Robots Smashing Into Other Giant Robots](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/)—Thoughbot is a software development consultancy with awesome posts.

[Signal v Noise](https://m.signalvnoise.com/)—Basecamp's strong opinions and shared thoughts on design, business, and tech. Not so closely tied to Rails development, more of a tech philosophy blog.

[Arkency blog](http://blog.arkency.com/)—Arkency is a Rails consultancy based in Poland that releases a fair amount of good blog posts.

## Reddit & Ruby flow

Most of the stuff that you'll see in the RubyWeekly is curated from [RubyWeekly](http://www.rubyflow.com/), a community link log by Peter Cooper (the person behind RubyWeekly). This is probably the best resource that you can find among Ruby pages.

There's also reddit, with the [r/ruby](http://reddit.com/r/ruby) subreddit as the best resource. There's also [r/rails](http://reddit.com/r/rails), but it's not as good as r/ruby.


## Twitter

Good twitter accounts to follow for learning interesting information about Ruby and Rails (with none to little tweets that aren't tied to Ruby):

* [Ruby Slovenia](https://twitter.com/RubySlovenia)
* [Rails Bot](https://twitter.com/rails_bot)

## Sharing

When you find something interesting, do share it with the rest of the team through our team's email address. We'd love to hear what you find interesting! You can also drop it in our `#newsletter-rails` slack channel, where Nenad curates content for RubyDrops.
