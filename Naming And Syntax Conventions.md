The Infinum Rails Team uses the [community guidelines](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#naming) for naming and syntax conventions. Please read it.

We use a Ruby style-checking analyzer called [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) to preserve syntax consistency in our applicationsâ€”it's packaged as a Ruby gem and comes with a CLI to check style consistency. Although that's nice, we prefer to use it as a plugin for our favorite editors to get real time in-editor warnings just as we're writing code. Whether you're using Vim, Atom or Sublime, please check that it's properly installed after you've run our installation scripts.

Rubocop is highly configurable, and we deviate only slightly from the suggested guidelines.
Our configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/infinum/guides/blob/master/rails/.rubocop.yml).

* We use a max of 100 characters per line instead of 80 characters.
* We tend not to write documentation for every class or module. It doesn't make sense to document a User, Post, or a Comment class. However, sometimes applications tend to have a Domain-Specific Business Logic that just needs to be documented since, without a few comments, it often isn't clear what's going on. If that's the case, feel free to write up a few comments explaining the interactions.
* The community guidelines suggest to write arrays with string elements with the [percent notation](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Syntax/Literals#The_.25_Notation):

```
developers = %w(Lucas John Tommy)
```

instead of

```
developers = ['Lucas', 'John', 'Tommy']
```

We find it OK to write string arrays the second way for two reasons:  

* we never remember to write them with the percent notation in the first place, so we always have to change them afterwards.
* the percent notation looks odd when you have multiple words in one string:

```
developers = %w(Lucas John Tommy Herman\ Zvonimir)
```
