Every single project is different, and you can always learn something new and useful. We've found a way for developers to share their knowledge with each other.

Every few weeks we generate pairs for weekly code reviews. They usually last between 1 and 1.5 hours, and we use that time to review each other's code from that week.

There are several ways to review code:  

* going through commits
* going through pull requests
* showing a specific part of our code we are proud of or have problems with

We give each other suggestions on how to improve our code, generally suggest better ways to solve something, or even try to find a solution together.   

By switching over projects every few weeks, we have a chance to get to know more projects and their code, and learn a lot of new and exciting things.

You have to have a code review every week, and you can clock them under Internal/Education. When new code review pairs are generated, please remember to book a conference room a few weeks in advance.
