[Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29) is a ~~cleaning
product~~ (primarily) terminal-based modal text editor first released in 1991.
Despite its old age, it is still one of [the most popular text editors](http://www.askr.me/ruby#ember1447) for
editing source code thanks to its text editing power and flexibility.

* [Effective Rails Development with Vim](http://www.sitepoint.com/effective-rails-development-vim/), by Islam Wazery
A really good article for Rails development, that goes through the features of the excellent rails-vim plugin, as well as a couple of other plugins that make development in Rails much nicer.

## Tips
* Make sure you [remap your Caps Lock to Escape](http://stackoverflow.com/a/8437594)  
You might think you'll miss the Caps Lock key, but in reality, it's much less
useful than it seems, and the convenience of having your Escape key so close
to your pinky is invaluable when switching from insert mode to normal mode. Once
you get used to it, you'll never go back.

* Use Infinum's [dotfiles](https://github.com/infinum/dotfiles) before you learn how to configure Vim  
Vim requires some configuration in order to look nicer, and to make it a bit
saner to use since its default configurations are pretty bad. The dotfiles also
install some necessary plugins that you won't be able to live without.
